# Test harness: boot straight into a level, skip the intro, hold a look angle, screenshot the window.
#
# Usage: tools/harness.sh <level-id> <look-degrees> <out.png> [wait-seconds] [binary]
#   level ids: 26 Frigate, 33 Dam, 34 Facility, 35 Runway, 36 Surface (LEVELID_* in patches/structs.h)
#   look:      vertical look angle in degrees, e.g. 30 to look up at the sky, 0 straight ahead
#   binary:    defaults to build/GoldenRecomp; point it at another build to compare
#   GE_HARNESS_SKIP=0 in the environment lets the intro play out instead of skipping it.
#   GE_HARNESS_BUTTONS=<mask> holds N64 buttons on controller 1, e.g. 0x0010 = R (aim).
#
# The ROM must already be set up (picked once in the launcher). Needs spectacle (KDE).
